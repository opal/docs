# Opal Documentation Central

This repo will hold the keys for generating Opal API documentation and guides on the `master` branch, while the `gh-pages` branch will keep track of the generated docs. The source for the docs will be the Opal repo itself.

### Roadmap

The plan is to start by generating API docs for all known opal versions, as well as continually improving the coverage on the latest release.
